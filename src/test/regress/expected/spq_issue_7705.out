--- Test for verifying that column references (var nodes) in targets that cannot be pushed down
--- do not cause issues for the postgres planner, in particular postgres versions 16+, where the
--- varnullingrels field of a VAR node may contain relids of join relations that can make the var
--- NULL; in a rewritten distributed query without a join such relids do not have a meaning.
